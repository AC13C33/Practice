library(tidyverse)
```

The purpose of this file is to present a coupld of basic plots using `ggplot`.

First we create a datafram containing variables for our plots.

```{r df_create}
set.seed(1234)

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
```

First we show a histogram of the `x` variable.

```{r x_hist}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

Next we show a scatter plot of `y` vs `x`.

```{r yx_scatter}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```
